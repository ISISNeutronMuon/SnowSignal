# Note that this complex local development docker compose still can't answer most
# questions we might want to ask about the UDP broadcast setup. The reason is that
# if we isolate the p4p containers from each other so their UDP broadcast messages 
# must route throuhg the SnowSignal servers then they can't use direct UDP or TCP 
# to create connections. On the other hand if they can see each other then the 
# SnowSignal infrastructure is irrelevant.
